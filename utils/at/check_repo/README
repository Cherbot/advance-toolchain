This directory contains some scripts that automates the runs of the AT's FVTR.

These scripts check if there are newer packages of the Advance Toolchain in
preconfigured repositories. For each newly available version, it mounts a
previously created chroot and installs the new version of the Advance
Toolchain and automatically runs the FVTR.

As they were created to be executed by crond, they only print messages
on stdout when an unexpected error occurs.

These scripts require the following applications:
- expect
- ftp
- Tcl
- tcllib or mail
- wget

The basic setup requires:

- Chroot files - It requires at least 2 chroot tarballs: one for RHEL
  and another for SLES. They should be named chroot_RHEL6.2.tar.gz and
  chroot_SLES11.2.tar.gz.
  These files must create only the directory chroot when exploded,
  which is the root of the chroot.

- FVTR files - It is necessary to provide a tarball named
  fvtr.tar.bz2. When extracted, it should create only the directory fvtr.

- Global settings - This file specifies global settings, like the place where
  all config files are stored, the SMTP server and the recipients which will
  receive an email in the end of the execution. It must be named
  $config_dir/$config_file (default name is .config/config)

- Repository settings - all the settings are available in the $config_dir
  directory. Each repository is represented by a directory with the suffix
  '.repo', i.e.: '.config/gsa-SLES11.repo/'.
  Inside this directory there are 2 files: config and ignore. The
  first one describes the repository settings and the last one is a
  list of ignored (already tested) versions of the Advance Toolchain.
  For more information about these files, read shared.exp.

The main script is check_repo.exp and doesn't accept parameters.
For more information about each script, please read their headers.
