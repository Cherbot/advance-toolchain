<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>
A cross compiler is a compiler that runs in a certain processor
architecture (host architecture) but is able to generate executable
code to a different processor architecture (target
architecture) <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
The Advance Toolchain provides cross compilers that run on x86
and generate code for Power which help teams to start developing for
Power without having immediate access to a POWER server.
A cross compiler doesn't completely remove the dependency on the
target processor because users still have to test and run the
executable code on a different processor.
</p>


<h2 id="sample">Building a sample program</h2>
<p>
GNU wget <sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> is a small
program that highlights the important problems when cross compiling a certain
software: it depends on libraries provided by the Advance Toolchain cross
compiler and external libraries.
</p>

<p>
In this example, we'll build GNU wget for POWER little-endian, using a
x86 computer with the Advance Toolchain cross compiler.
</p>


<h3 id="libs">Copy headers and libraries</h3>
<p>
Firstly, it is necessary to copy all necessary libraries and headers
to a certain directory.  In this example I'll use:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Headers: ${HOME}/wget/include</li>
    <li>Libraries: ${HOME}/wget/lib</li>
</ul>

<p>
In this case, ${HOME} is a shell variable holding the path of my home
directory.
</p>

<p>
For GNU wget, we need to provide some OpenSSL libraries and Zlib.
Both of them are available in the Advance Toolchain native compiler.
However, the list of necessary libraries may vary according to the
project.  If you don't know well the project you can use the following
tools in order to identify the list of libraries they use:
</p>

<pre>
ldd &lt;executable&gt;
rpm -q --requires -p &lt;package.rpm&gt;
dpkg-deb -f &lt;package.deb&gt; | grep "Depends:"
</pre>

<p>
Usually the list of libraries necessary to build a project is the same
across all processor architectures.  So, you may use the above
commands against an executable or package compiled for another processor.
</p>

<p>
This is the list of files required in order to build wget:
</p>

<pre>
$ ls -1 ${HOME}/wget/include/
openssl/
zconf.h
zlib.h
$ ls -1 ${HOME}/wget/lib/
libcrypto.so
libcrypto.so.1.0.0
libssl.so
libssl.so.1.0.0
libz.so
libz.so.1
libz.so.1.2.6
</pre>

<p>
Make sure the libraries are really compiled for the target processor.
If they don't match, you won't be able to use them.
You may use 'readelf -h' to verify this information:
</p>

<pre>
$ /opt/at7.1/bin/powerpc64le-linux-gnu-readelf -h ${HOME}/wget/lib/libz.so.1.2.6
...
  Data:                              2's complement, little endian
...
  Machine:                           PowerPC64
...
</pre>
<h3 id="build">Build</h3>
<p>
With the header files and libraries in place, the system is ready to
start the build.  So, create a separate build directory:
</p>

<pre>mkdir ${HOME}/wget/build &amp;&amp; cd ${HOME}/wget/build
</pre>

<p>
After entering the separate build directory, it's possible to
configure the build by running:
</p>

<pre>CC=/opt/at7.1/bin/powerpc64le-linux-gnu-gcc \
CFLAGS="-I${HOME}/wget/include" \
LDFLAGS="-L${HOME}/wget/lib" \
        ../wget-1.15/configure \
                --host=powerpc64le-linux \
                --with-ssl=openssl
</pre>

<p>
Where:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>CC</b> specifies which compiler to use. In this case, Advance
Toolchain 7.1 cross compiler for POWER little endian.
Cross compilers usually have a prefix in their program name
to clearly indicate they won't generate executable code for
the current processor.  In this case, the prefix is
"powerpc64le-linux-gnu-".  This rule applies to all programs,
e.g. g++, gdb, ld, as, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>CFLAGS="-I"</b> indicates where the compiler will find the header files.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>LDFLAGS="-L"</b> indicates where the linker will find the libraries.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>../wget-1.15</b> this is the directory where wget source code is
available. In this case it is the same of
${HOME}/wget/wget-1.15.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>--host=powerpc64le-linux</b> indicates this code will run on POWER
little endian.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>--with-ssl=openssl</b> forces wget to use OpenSSL.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
Finally, build wget:
</p>

<pre>make
</pre>

<p>
After running this you'll find the program available at
${HOME}/wget/build/src/wget.
</p>

<p>
You can now copy it to a POWER little endian system <b>with the Advance Toolchain
runtime package installed</b> and run it.
</p>


<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#faq1">Are cross compiler builds slower?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#faq2">If I build a program using a cross compiler will it be slower than using a native toolchain?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#faq3">My project doesn't allow to pass flags to the linker or to the compiler. How can I use extra libraries?</a></li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="faq1">Are cross compiler builds slower?</a></h3>
<p>
Not necessarily.  It depends on the code being built and the
level of optimization in use.
</p>

<h3><a name="faq2">If I build a program using a cross compiler will it be slower than using a native toolchain?</a></h3>
<p>
No.  There are some differences in the metadata of the binaries, but
it will run at the same speed.
</p>

<h3><a name="faq3">My project doesn't allow to pass flags to the linker or to the compiler. How can I use extra libraries?</a></h3>
<p>
  In this case, it isn't possible to pass -I to the compiler or -L to linker and
  the only possible solution is to save the headers and libraries in one of the
  Advance Toolchain directories:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>For POWER big endian (ppc or ppc64)</b>: <br>
      /opt/atX.X/ppc/usr/include<br>
      /opt/atX.X/ppc/usr/lib (32-bit libraries)<br>
      /opt/atX.X/ppc/usr/lib64 (64-bit libraries)
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>For POWER little endian (ppc64le)</b>: <br>
      /opt/atX.X/ppc64le/usr/include<br>
      /opt/atX.X/ppc64le/usr/lib64
    </li>
  </ul>
  Be careful to not override any Advance Toolchain files while copying the
  files.
</p>
